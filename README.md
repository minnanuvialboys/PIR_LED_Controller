# PIR_LED_Controller

This project uses an Arduino to control an LED with a PIR sensor. When motion is detected by the PIR sensor, the LED turns on.

## Components

- PIR Sensor
- LED
- Resistor (220 ohms)
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Wiring

- PIR Sensor: VCC to 5V, GND to GND, OUT to pin 2
- LED: Anode to pin 13 (with resistor in series), Cathode to GND

## Code

The Arduino code is available in the `arduino_code` directory.
